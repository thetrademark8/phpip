## Phase 2.2: Case Preservation - SKIPPED

**Date**: 2025-06-26  
**Status**: Skipped pending client clarification

### Reason for Skipping
The database collation was previously changed to ensure uniform case handling across the system. Before implementing case preservation for matter titles, we need clarification from the client on:

1. The specific collation requirements
2. Whether the current lowercase conversion is intentional for search/sorting purposes
3. The desired behavior for case preservation vs. case-insensitive searching

This task will be revisited once the client provides more information about their specific requirements for case handling.

## Next Steps
Proceeding with Phase 2.3: Company Branding (static logo implementation)
