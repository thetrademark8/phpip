# Matter Index Refactoring Summary

## Date: 2025-06-29

### Completed Tasks

1. **Created Service Layer Architecture**
   - `MatterService` - Implements business logic for matter operations
   - `MatterRepository` - Handles all database queries with clean query builder pattern
   - `MatterServiceInterface` - Contract for dependency injection

2. **Implemented Form Request Validation**
   - `MatterFilterRequest` - Validates and normalizes filter parameters
   - Handles boolean conversion and parameter preparation

3. **Refactored Controller**
   - `MatterController` now follows Single Responsibility Principle
   - Uses dependency injection for MatterServiceInterface
   - Thin controller with only HTTP concerns

4. **Frontend Service Layer**
   - `MatterFilterService` - Centralized filter logic and API calls
   - `useMatterFilters` composable - Reusable filter state management
   - Removed inline business logic from Vue components

5. **Code Cleanup**
   - Removed debug console.log statements
   - Used constants from centralized location
   - Improved code organization and maintainability

### Key Improvements

- **SOLID Principles**: All new code follows SOLID principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers
- **Testability**: Service classes can be easily unit tested
- **Maintainability**: Business logic is centralized and reusable
- **Performance**: No changes to query performance

### Architecture Overview

```
Controller (HTTP) → Service (Business Logic) → Repository (Database)
                           ↓
                    ServiceInterface (Contract)
```

### Next Steps

1. Create unit tests for the new service classes
2. Continue with Phase 3.3: Matter Show page implementation
3. Apply similar refactoring patterns to other controllers
