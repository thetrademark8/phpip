# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

phpIP is a Laravel-based IP (Intellectual Property) rights portfolio management system for law firms, originally developed by [jjdejong](https://github.com/jjdejong/phpip). This repository is a fork focused on modernizing the codebase and optimizing it for trademark management while maintaining support for designs and other IP assets.

### Fork Context
- **License**: GPL-3.0 (maintaining open-source compatibility)
- **Original Focus**: Patent management
- **New Focus**: ADD trademark management while PRESERVING all patent functionality
- **Goal**: Create a unified IP management system for both patents and trademarks

**IMPORTANT**: This fork aims to ADD comprehensive trademark functionality while PRESERVING all existing patent features. The goal is not to replace patent functionality but to create a unified IP management system that handles both patents and trademarks effectively.

The project manages patents, trademarks, designs, and other IP assets with features including multi-language support, document merging, automated task reminders, and various integrations.

## Code Quality Standards

### SOLID Principles
**All new code in this project MUST follow SOLID principles**. These principles ensure maintainable, scalable, and testable code:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Each class should have only one reason to change
   - Controllers should only handle HTTP requests/responses
   - Business logic belongs in Service classes
   - Models should only handle data and relationships

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
   - Use interfaces and abstract classes for extensibility
   - Leverage Laravel's service container for dependency injection

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
   - Implement interfaces fully and correctly
   - Avoid breaking contracts established by parent classes

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use
   - Create specific interfaces rather than large, general ones
   - Use Laravel's contracts when appropriate

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
   - Use dependency injection via constructors
   - Leverage Laravel's IoC container for managing dependencies

### Code Style
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards (enforced by Laravel Pint)
- Use type declarations for all method parameters and return types
- Document complex logic with clear comments
- Write unit tests for all new service classes

```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Business Logic
- **Models** (`app/Models/`): Eloquent models representing IP entities (Matter, Actor, Task, Event, etc.)
  - Key model: `Matter` - represents patents, trademarks, or designs
  - `Actor` - people/companies involved in matters
  - `Task` - deadlines and actions for matters
  - `Event` - history and status changes for matters

- **Controllers** (`app/Http/Controllers/`): HTTP request handlers
  - `MatterController`: Main controller for IP matter management
  - `ActorController`: Manages actors (applicants, inventors, etc.)
  - `TaskController`: Handles task/deadline management
  - `DocumentController`: File upload and document management

- **Services** (`app/Services/`): Business logic services
  - `DocumentMergeService`: Merges data into DOCX templates
  - `MatterExportService`: Exports matter data to Excel
  - `OpsService`: Integrates with EPO Open Patent Services
  - `SharePointService`: Optional SharePoint integration

### Frontend Architecture
- **Views** (`resources/views/`): Blade templates using Bootstrap 5
  - Layout: `layouts/app.blade.php`
  - Modular components in subdirectories by feature
- **JavaScript** (`resources/js/`): Vanilla JS and Bootstrap components
- **Styles** (`resources/sass/`): SCSS files compiled by Vite

### Key Features Implementation
1. **Multi-language Support**: Uses Spatie Laravel Translatable package
   - Translations stored in database
   - Managed via `app/Models/Translation.php`
   - Console command: `php artisan translations:refresh`

2. **Document Templates**: DOCX templates in `storage/app/templates/`
   - Uses PHPWord for document generation
   - Template variables replaced with matter data

3. **Task Reminders**: Automated email system
   - Command: `php artisan tasks:send-due-email`
   - Configured in Laravel scheduler

4. **Renewal Management**: Integration with Renewr.io
   - Command: `php artisan renewr:sync`
   - Stores renewal data and calculates fees

### Database Structure
- Uses MySQL/MariaDB
- Key tables: `matter`, `actor`, `task`, `event`, `matter_actor_lnk`
- Pivot tables for many-to-many relationships
- JSON columns for flexible data storage (e.g., `renewal_data`)

### Authentication & Authorization
- Laravel's built-in authentication
- Role-based access control via `default_role` table
- Client isolation for multi-tenant usage

### External Integrations
- **EPO OPS API**: Patent data retrieval (`app/Services/OpsService.php`)
- **Renewr.io**: Renewal fee calculations
- **SharePoint**: Optional document storage
- **AQS**: Patent search integration (`resources/scripts/integration_aqs.js`)

## Important Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Critical settings in `.env`:
   - Database connection
   - Mail configuration for task reminders
   - OPS API credentials
   - SharePoint credentials (if used)

2. **File Storage**: Documents stored in `storage/app/` by default
   - Can be configured to use SharePoint
   - Templates in `storage/app/templates/`

3. **Queue Processing**: Required for:
   - Sending emails
   - Background data syncing
   - Run with `php artisan queue:work`

4. **Scheduled Tasks**: Configure cron to run `php artisan schedule:run` every minute for:
   - Translation refresh (daily)
   - Renewal sync (daily)
   - Task reminders (daily)

## Phase 1 Completion Status

### âœ… Completed in Phase 1:
1. **Pest Testing Framework**
   - Installed and configured Pest PHP v3
   - Converted existing PHPUnit tests to Pest syntax
   - Added helper functions and custom expectations
   - Created architecture tests to enforce SOLID principles

2. **Date Standardization Foundation**
   - Audited current date usage (uses locale-based formats)
   - Created `DateServiceInterface` and `DateService` implementation
   - All dates will be standardized to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Added comprehensive date handling tests

3. **Service Layer Architecture**
   - Created service interfaces: `MatterServiceInterface`, `RenewalServiceInterface`, `NotificationServiceInterface`
   - Implemented `RepositoryServiceProvider` for dependency injection
   - Placeholder implementations ready for Phase 2 development

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
   - Tests run on PHP 8.2 and 8.3
   - Code style checks with Laravel Pint
   - Architecture tests for SOLID compliance

5. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - SQLite in-memory database for fast tests
   - Test environment configuration (.env.testing)
   - Comprehensive test documentation
   - Composer scripts for easy test execution

6. **Database Seeding Refactoring**
   - Created model factories for Actor, Matter, Event, Task, and Classifier
   - Implemented three-tier seeding strategy (Production, Development, Test)
   - Replaced hardcoded sample data with flexible factories
   - Deprecated old sample seeders (moved to Deprecated/ directory)

### Using the New Services

When implementing new features, use dependency injection:

```php
use App\Contracts\Services\DateServiceInterface;

class MatterController extends Controller
{
    public function __construct(
        private DateServiceInterface $dateService
    ) {}
    
    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        $isoDate = $this->dateService->normalizeToIso($request->date);
        // Use $isoDate for storage
    }
}
```

## Database Seeding Strategy

The project uses a three-tier seeding strategy to separate concerns:

### 1. ProductionSeeder
- Contains only essential reference data (countries, roles, categories, events)
- Creates default admin user (login: admin, password: changeme)
- Should be run ONCE during initial production deployment
- Located in `database/seeders/ProductionSeeder.php`

### 2. DevelopmentSeeder
- Includes all production data
- Adds sample companies, inventors, matters, events using factories
- Creates realistic test scenarios with patents and trademarks
- Perfect for development and demos
- Located in `database/seeders/DevelopmentSeeder.php`

### 3. TestSeeder
- Minimal data required for automated tests
- Tests should create their own specific data using factories
- Ensures fast test execution
- Located in `database/seeders/TestSeeder.php`

### Model Factories

All major models now have factories for flexible test data generation:
- **ActorFactory**: Creates companies, persons, agents with realistic data
- **MatterFactory**: Generates patents, trademarks, designs with proper relationships
- **EventFactory**: Creates filing, publication, grant events with appropriate dates
- **TaskFactory**: Generates renewals, deadlines, responses with states
- **ClassifierFactory**: Creates titles, IPC/Nice classes, logos

### Factory Usage Examples

```php
// Create a patent with all related data
$patent = Matter::factory()
    ->patent()
    ->has(Event::factory()->filing())
    ->has(Event::factory()->publication())
    ->has(Classifier::factory()->title())
    ->create();

// Create a trademark portfolio
$company = Actor::factory()->company()->create();
$trademark = Matter::factory()
    ->trademark()
    ->for($company, 'client')
    ->has(Classifier::factory()->nice()->count(3))
    ->create();

// Create renewal tasks
$grantEvent = Event::factory()->grant()->create();
Task::factory()
    ->renewal()
    ->forEvent($grantEvent)
    ->forRenewalYear(5)
    ->create();
```

## Refactoring Goals & Planned Features

### Technical Refactoring Objectives
- **Modernization**: Update to current web development standards

- **Multiple Images**: Support multiple images per matter record

### Recent Additions (2025-05-27)
- **Design Patents**: Display registration date and number in "granted/reg'd" and "number" columns

## Phase 2.1 Completion Status - Interactive Calendar with Date Standardization

### âœ… Completed in Phase 2.1:

1. **Date Picker Implementation**
   - Installed Flatpickr (`npm install flatpickr`)
   - Created `DatePickerComponent.js` with AJAX-aware auto-initialization
   - Implemented MutationObserver for dynamic content support
   - Added French locale support with proper error handling
   - Fixed timezone issues with custom ISO formatting

2. **Service Layer for Date Handling**
   - Created `DatePickerServiceInterface` following SOLID principles
   - Implemented `DatePickerService` with flexible date parsing
   - Supports multiple input formats: DD/MM/YYYY, DD-MM-YYYY, DD.MM.YYYY, ISO
   - Added strict validation to prevent invalid date auto-correction

3. **Middleware for Automatic Date Conversion**
   - Created `ValidateDateFields` middleware
   - Automatically converts all date fields to ISO format before validation
   - Handles both AJAX and traditional form submissions
   - Returns proper validation errors with original format

4. **Blade Component System**
   - Created reusable `DateInput` component
   - Dual input system: visible formatted input + hidden ISO input
   - Optional label display with `showLabel` parameter
   - Integrated with existing form change handlers

5. **Views Updated (16 date fields across 9 views)**
   - matter/events.blade.php (event_date)
   - matter/tasks.blade.php (due_date, done_date)
   - matter/roleActors.blade.php (date)
   - rule/create.blade.php (active_from, active_to)
   - rule/show.blade.php (active_from, active_to)
   - fee/create.blade.php (from, to)
   - renewals/index.blade.php (start_date, end_date)
   - renewals/logs.blade.php (from_date, to_date)
   - home.blade.php (expire_date)

6. **Controller Updates**
   - Removed locale-specific date parsing from EventController, TaskController, HomeController
   - Simplified to use Carbon::parse() or createFromFormat('Y-m-d')
   - Middleware now handles all format conversions

### Key Technical Decisions:

1. **Timezone-Neutral Date Handling**
   ```javascript
   // Avoid using toISOString() which converts to UTC
   formatDateToIso(date) {
       if (!date) return '';
       return `${date.getFullYear()}-${String(date.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0')}-${String(date.getDate()).padStart(2, '0')}`;
   }
   ```

2. **AJAX Compatibility**
   - MutationObserver watches for DOM changes
   - Automatic reinitialization of date pickers
   - Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

3. **Integration with Existing Systems**
   - Preserved existing noformat change handlers
   - Synthetic event triggering for compatibility
   - Maintained all existing save functionality

### Testing:
- Created comprehensive Pest tests for DatePickerService
- 45 tests with 113 assertions covering all edge cases
- Tests for flexible parsing, validation, and conversion

### Important Commands:
```bash
# Run tests for date functionality
./vendor/bin/pest --filter=DatePickerService

# Rebuild assets after Flatpickr installation
npm run build

# Check for any date-related issues
php artisan pint
```

### Lessons Learned:
1. **Timezone Bug**: JavaScript's toISOString() converts to UTC, causing date shifts. Always use timezone-neutral formatting for date-only fields.
2. **AJAX Integration**: MutationObserver is essential for dynamic content. Always destroy existing instances before reinitializing.
3. **Locale Support**: Import specific locales explicitly to avoid console errors.
4. **Event Handling**: Synthetic events must be dispatched after programmatic value changes for existing handlers to work.

## Phase 2.2 Status - Case Preservation

**Status**: SKIPPED - Pending client clarification
**Date**: 2025-06-26

This phase was skipped because the database collation was previously changed to ensure uniform case handling across the system. Before implementing case preservation for matter titles, clarification is needed from the client regarding:
- The specific collation requirements
- Whether the current lowercase conversion is intentional for search/sorting purposes
- The desired behavior for case preservation vs. case-insensitive searching

See TODO.md for details.

## Phase 2.3 Completion Status - Company Branding (Static Logo)

### âœ… Completed in Phase 2.3:

1. **Static Logo Configuration**
   - Added `COMPANY_LOGO` environment variable to `.env.example`
   - Added logo configuration to `config/app.php`
   - Each IP firm instance can configure their own logo path

2. **Logo Storage Structure**
   - Created `/public/images/logos/` directory
   - Added README.md with usage instructions
   - Created sample SVG logo for testing

3. **UI Implementation**
   - Updated navbar in `layouts/app.blade.php`:
     - Logo displays before app name
     - Responsive sizing (max 40px height, 150px width)
     - Only shows if configured
   - Updated login page:
     - Logo centered above login form
     - Larger size for better visibility (max 80px height, 250px width)

4. **Testing**
   - Created `CompanyLogoTest` with comprehensive coverage
   - Tests configuration access, login page display, and navbar display
   - All 4 tests passing

### Key Design Decisions:

1. **Static Configuration Approach**
   - Used environment variables instead of database storage
   - Each IP firm has one instance with a fixed logo
   - Simple `.env` configuration: `COMPANY_LOGO=images/logos/company-logo.png`

2. **Flexible Implementation**
   - Logo display is conditional - works without configuration
   - Supports PNG, JPG, and SVG formats
   - Uses Bootstrap classes for responsive behavior

3. **Accessibility**
   - Alt text uses company name from configuration
   - Maintains visual hierarchy with proper sizing

4. **Logo/Text Display Logic**
   - When logo is configured: Only logo displays in navbar (text is hidden)
   - When no logo configured: App name displays as text
   - Provides cleaner branding when logo is available

### Usage Instructions:

1. Place your company logo in `/public/images/logos/`
2. Update your `.env` file:
   ```
   COMPANY_LOGO=images/logos/your-logo.png
   ```
3. Logo will automatically appear in navbar and login page
4. App name text will be hidden in navbar when logo is present

This completes Phase 2 of the refactoring plan. The UI/UX improvements are now implemented with date standardization, skipped case preservation (pending clarification), and static company branding with intelligent logo/text display.

## UI Refactoring: Laravel Blade to Inertia.js + Vue.js + shadcn-vue

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup âœ…

Successfully implemented the foundation for the UI refactoring from Laravel Blade templates to a modern SPA using Inertia.js, Vue.js 3, and shadcn-vue.

#### 1.1 Core Dependencies Installed âœ…
- **Inertia.js server-side**: `composer require inertiajs/inertia-laravel`

- **CSS configuration**: Set up with `@import "tailwindcss"` and CSS variables
- **Theme setup**: Configured design tokens using `:root` CSS variables
- **shadcn-vue config**: Created `components.json` with proper paths
- **Utilities**: Created `cn()` utility function in `lib/utils.js`

#### 1.4 Base Layout Components âœ…
- **MainLayout.vue**: Main layout wrapper with navigation and footer
- **Navigation.vue**: Top navbar with logo/text logic and auth status
- **Footer.vue**: Simple footer component
- **Test page**: Created `Test.vue` to verify setup

### Key Technical Decisions:

1. **Tailwind CSS v4**: Using the new CSS-based configuration approach with `@theme` directive
2. **Component structure**: Organized with `/Pages`, `/Components`, `/Layouts` directories
3. **State management**: Using Inertia's shared data for global state
4. **Styling approach**: CSS variables for theming, supporting light/dark modes
5. **Build setup**: Vite configured with Vue and Tailwind plugins

### Verification:
- Build successful: `npm run build` completes without errors
- Test route created: `/test-inertia` to verify Inertia rendering
- All dependencies properly installed and configured

### Next Steps:
Continue with Phase 2 (Component Library Development) to:
1. Replace the custom DatePicker with shadcn-vue DatePicker
2. Create reusable components (MatterCard, ActorList, etc.)
3. Build form components with Zod validation
4. Start migrating actual pages from Blade to Vue

## Phase 2: Component Library Development

### Phase 2.1: DatePicker Replacement âœ…

Successfully replaced the complex 345-line jQuery DatePicker with a clean Vue component:
