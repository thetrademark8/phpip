# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

phpIP is a Laravel-based IP (Intellectual Property) rights portfolio management system for law firms, originally developed by [jjdejong](https://github.com/jjdejong/phpip). This repository is a fork focused on modernizing the codebase and optimizing it for trademark management while maintaining support for designs and other IP assets.

### Fork Context
- **License**: GPL-3.0 (maintaining open-source compatibility)
- **Original Focus**: Patent management
- **New Focus**: ADD trademark management while PRESERVING all patent functionality
- **Goal**: Create a unified IP management system for both patents and trademarks

**IMPORTANT**: This fork aims to ADD comprehensive trademark functionality while PRESERVING all existing patent features. The goal is not to replace patent functionality but to create a unified IP management system that handles both patents and trademarks effectively.

The project manages patents, trademarks, designs, and other IP assets with features including multi-language support, document merging, automated task reminders, and various integrations.

## Code Quality Standards

### SOLID Principles
**All new code in this project MUST follow SOLID principles**. These principles ensure maintainable, scalable, and testable code:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Each class should have only one reason to change
   - Controllers should only handle HTTP requests/responses
   - Business logic belongs in Service classes
   - Models should only handle data and relationships

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
   - Use interfaces and abstract classes for extensibility
   - Leverage Laravel's service container for dependency injection

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
   - Implement interfaces fully and correctly
   - Avoid breaking contracts established by parent classes

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use
   - Create specific interfaces rather than large, general ones
   - Use Laravel's contracts when appropriate

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
   - Use dependency injection via constructors
   - Leverage Laravel's IoC container for managing dependencies

### Code Style
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards (enforced by Laravel Pint)
- Use type declarations for all method parameters and return types
- Document complex logic with clear comments
- Write unit tests for all new service classes

# Seeding strategies (use one based on environment):
php artisan db:seed --class=ProductionSeeder   # Production: Essential data only
php artisan db:seed --class=DevelopmentSeeder  # Development: Sample data with factories
php artisan db:seed --class=TestSeeder         # Testing: Minimal data for tests
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Business Logic
- **Models** (`app/Models/`): Eloquent models representing IP entities (Matter, Actor, Task, Event, etc.)
  - Key model: `Matter` - represents patents, trademarks, or designs
  - `Actor` - people/companies involved in matters
  - `Task` - deadlines and actions for matters
  - `Event` - history and status changes for matters

- **Controllers** (`app/Http/Controllers/`): HTTP request handlers
  - `MatterController`: Main controller for IP matter management
  - `ActorController`: Manages actors (applicants, inventors, etc.)
  - `TaskController`: Handles task/deadline management
  - `DocumentController`: File upload and document management

- **Services** (`app/Services/`): Business logic services
  - `DocumentMergeService`: Merges data into DOCX templates
  - `MatterExportService`: Exports matter data to Excel
  - `OpsService`: Integrates with EPO Open Patent Services
  - `SharePointService`: Optional SharePoint integration

### Frontend Architecture
- **Views** (`resources/views/`): Blade templates using Bootstrap 5
  - Layout: `layouts/app.blade.php`
  - Modular components in subdirectories by feature
- **JavaScript** (`resources/js/`): Vanilla JS and Bootstrap components
- **Styles** (`resources/sass/`): SCSS files compiled by Vite

### Key Features Implementation
1. **Multi-language Support**: Uses Spatie Laravel Translatable package
   - Translations stored in database
   - Managed via `app/Models/Translation.php`
   - Console command: `php artisan translations:refresh`

2. **Document Templates**: DOCX templates in `storage/app/templates/`
   - Uses PHPWord for document generation
   - Template variables replaced with matter data

3. **Task Reminders**: Automated email system
   - Command: `php artisan tasks:send-due-email`
   - Configured in Laravel scheduler

4. **Renewal Management**: Integration with Renewr.io
   - Command: `php artisan renewr:sync`
   - Stores renewal data and calculates fees

### Database Structure
- Uses MySQL/MariaDB
- Key tables: `matter`, `actor`, `task`, `event`, `matter_actor_lnk`
- Pivot tables for many-to-many relationships
- JSON columns for flexible data storage (e.g., `renewal_data`)

### Authentication & Authorization
- Laravel's built-in authentication
- Role-based access control via `default_role` table
- Client isolation for multi-tenant usage

### External Integrations
- **EPO OPS API**: Patent data retrieval (`app/Services/OpsService.php`)
- **Renewr.io**: Renewal fee calculations
- **SharePoint**: Optional document storage
- **AQS**: Patent search integration (`resources/scripts/integration_aqs.js`)

## Important Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Critical settings in `.env`:
   - Database connection
   - Mail configuration for task reminders
   - OPS API credentials
   - SharePoint credentials (if used)

2. **File Storage**: Documents stored in `storage/app/` by default
   - Can be configured to use SharePoint
   - Templates in `storage/app/templates/`

3. **Queue Processing**: Required for:
   - Sending emails
   - Background data syncing
   - Run with `php artisan queue:work`

4. **Scheduled Tasks**: Configure cron to run `php artisan schedule:run` every minute for:
   - Translation refresh (daily)
   - Renewal sync (daily)
   - Task reminders (daily)

## Phase 1 Completion Status

### âœ… Completed in Phase 1:
1. **Pest Testing Framework**
   - Installed and configured Pest PHP v3
   - Converted existing PHPUnit tests to Pest syntax
   - Added helper functions and custom expectations
   - Created architecture tests to enforce SOLID principles

2. **Date Standardization Foundation**
   - Audited current date usage (uses locale-based formats)
   - Created `DateServiceInterface` and `DateService` implementation
   - All dates will be standardized to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Added comprehensive date handling tests

3. **Service Layer Architecture**
   - Created service interfaces: `MatterServiceInterface`, `RenewalServiceInterface`, `NotificationServiceInterface`
   - Implemented `RepositoryServiceProvider` for dependency injection
   - Placeholder implementations ready for Phase 2 development

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
   - Tests run on PHP 8.2 and 8.3
   - Code style checks with Laravel Pint
   - Architecture tests for SOLID compliance

5. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - SQLite in-memory database for fast tests
   - Test environment configuration (.env.testing)
   - Comprehensive test documentation
   - Composer scripts for easy test execution

6. **Database Seeding Refactoring**
   - Created model factories for Actor, Matter, Event, Task, and Classifier
   - Implemented three-tier seeding strategy (Production, Development, Test)
   - Replaced hardcoded sample data with flexible factories
   - Deprecated old sample seeders (moved to Deprecated/ directory)

### Using the New Services

When implementing new features, use dependency injection:

```php
use App\Contracts\Services\DateServiceInterface;

class MatterController extends Controller
{
    public function __construct(
        private DateServiceInterface $dateService
    ) {}
    
    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        $isoDate = $this->dateService->normalizeToIso($request->date);
        // Use $isoDate for storage
    }
}
```

## Database Seeding Strategy

The project uses a three-tier seeding strategy to separate concerns:

### 1. ProductionSeeder
- Contains only essential reference data (countries, roles, categories, events)
- Creates default admin user (login: admin, password: changeme)
- Should be run ONCE during initial production deployment
- Located in `database/seeders/ProductionSeeder.php`

### 2. DevelopmentSeeder
- Includes all production data
- Adds sample companies, inventors, matters, events using factories
- Creates realistic test scenarios with patents and trademarks
- Perfect for development and demos
- Located in `database/seeders/DevelopmentSeeder.php`

### 3. TestSeeder
- Minimal data required for automated tests
- Tests should create their own specific data using factories
- Ensures fast test execution
- Located in `database/seeders/TestSeeder.php`

### Model Factories

All major models now have factories for flexible test data generation:
- **ActorFactory**: Creates companies, persons, agents with realistic data
- **MatterFactory**: Generates patents, trademarks, designs with proper relationships
- **EventFactory**: Creates filing, publication, grant events with appropriate dates
- **TaskFactory**: Generates renewals, deadlines, responses with states
- **ClassifierFactory**: Creates titles, IPC/Nice classes, logos

### Factory Usage Examples

```php
// Create a patent with all related data
$patent = Matter::factory()
    ->patent()
    ->has(Event::factory()->filing())
    ->has(Event::factory()->publication())
    ->has(Classifier::factory()->title())
    ->create();

// Create a trademark portfolio
$company = Actor::factory()->company()->create();
$trademark = Matter::factory()
    ->trademark()
    ->for($company, 'client')
    ->has(Classifier::factory()->nice()->count(3))
    ->create();

// Create renewal tasks
$grantEvent = Event::factory()->grant()->create();
Task::factory()
    ->renewal()
    ->forEvent($grantEvent)
    ->forRenewalYear(5)
    ->create();
```
